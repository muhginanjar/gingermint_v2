/**
 * Minimal in-memory fixed-window rate limiter — zero dependencies.
 * Two layers: a global limiter in app.ts (DDoS baseline, excludes /health
 * and /assets/*) and a stricter one on auth routes (brute-force protection).
 * Hono middleware MUST call `next()` to continue the chain.
 *
 * Notes:
 *  - Per-process memory; fine for a single instance. For horizontal scaling
 *    swap this for a shared store (Redis) behind the same hook signature.
 *  - Client key: X-Forwarded-For first entry, else the peer IP (via the Bun
 *    server Bun passes as the 2nd fetch arg → `c.env`), else 'local'.
 *    Trust X-Forwarded-For only behind a proxy that sets it.
 *  - Why not hono-rate-limiter: its keyGenerator story leans on
 *    `hono/conninfo`, whose ESM build is an empty stub in hono 4.13. The
 *    hand-rolled version keeps the exact semantics with zero deps.
